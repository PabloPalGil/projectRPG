This is my second indie game project, a retro styled RPG game, inspired by the classics JRPG from the 16 bits gen.
The game is called "Unreal Universe" (WIP). It is a story-driven game and includes the following features:
<ul>
  A level system
  A variety of stats for each character
  A party of various characters
  Turn-based fighting mechanics inspired by Octopath Traveler series
  An overworld
  Some puzzle mechanics inspired by Zelda games
  Collection mechanics with a big pool of different enemies
</ul>

You can check some sample scripts in this repository. Again, I coded this out of my experience after completing my first game project (Race Zero), but I coded this before starting my official course as developer (DAW). I would use some OOP concepts now, if I had to do it again.
I have every important playable aspect of the game finished, and the tools needed to speed up development, but I have only released a demo so far.

You can watch the beginning of the demo (in spanish) here:

The demo has more content than shown in the previous video. And of course, you can download the demo apk here and give it a try yourself if you're curious:

I'm definitely finishing this project :)
